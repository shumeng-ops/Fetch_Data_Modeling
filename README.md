## Fetch Take Home Challenge Submission -- Shumeng Shi

This repository contains my submission for Fetchâ€™s take-home challenge for the Analytics Engineer position. My goal for this project was to showcase my technical skills across various data engineering tools. To demonstrate this, I built out the data model and warehouse directly in Snowflake and ran all queries within that environment. Below is a list of tools used to complete this project:

- **AWS S3 Bucket**: Stored JSON files for receipts, users, and brands
- **Snowflake**: Used as the data warehouse
- **DBT**: Built the data models that populate the data warehouse
